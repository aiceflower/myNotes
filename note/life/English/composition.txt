Dear Jack,
I am really happy to receive your letter. You know that I'm just lucky to win that contest, but I still thank you for your earnest congratulation. 
I can share what I have learnt and understood if you really want to sharpen translation skills. Maybe you should try a book named English-to-Chinese Translation for International Business, from which I have benefited greatly. Besides, I frequent online translation forums like Translators and Translation Geeks, where a great many users argue over difficult phrases and passages. Most of them are warmhearted, replying whenever you ask.
I sincerely hope that you can find a way to practice it , make improvement, and enjoy the skill.
		Yours sincerely,
		Li Ming
