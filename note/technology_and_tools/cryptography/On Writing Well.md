Anybody who can think clearly can write clearly, about any subject al all. That has always been the central premise of this book.

 Just because they are writing with ease and enjoyment doesn't mean they are writing well.

The word processor made good writers better and bad  writers worse。



**Transaction**

It was hard and lonely, and the words seldom just flowed.

The essence of writing is rewriting.

The professional writer must establish a daily schedule and stick to it.

I said that writing is a craft, not an art, and that the man who runs away from his craft because he lacks inspiration is fooling himself. He is also going broke.

I said that professional writers are solitary drudges who seldom see other writers.

**Simplicity**

But the secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components.

Clear thinking becomes clear writing.

Writers must therefore constantly ask: what am I trying to say?

 If you find that writing is hard, it's because it is hard.
